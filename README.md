# DEPI-final-project
For my DEPI graduation project, I conducted an in-depth data analysis on COVID-19, focusing on key metrics such as cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccination statistics across countries and regions. Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards and visualizations to highlight trends, identify patterns, and provide insights into the pandemic's global impact.
